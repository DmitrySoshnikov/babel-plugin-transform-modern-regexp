# babel-plugin-transform-modern-regexp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DmitrySoshnikov/babel-plugin-transform-modern-regexp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DmitrySoshnikov/babel-plugin-transform-modern-regexp) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/babel-plugin-transform-modern-regexp.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/babel-plugin-transform-modern-regexp)

Enables modern RegExp features in JavaScript.

You can get an overview of the plugin in [this article](https://medium.com/@DmitrySoshnikov/using-modern-regexes-in-javascript-30322af557c5).

## Features

The plugin enables the following features for JS regular expressions:

* "dotAll" `s`-flag (stage 3 proposal)
* Named capturing groups (stage 3 proposal)
* Extended `x`-flag (non-standard)

See also examples in [compat-transpile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regexp-tree#using-compat-transpiler-api), and [regexp extensions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regexp-tree#regexp-extensions) sections of [regexp-tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/regexp-tree).

### dotAll s-flag

See details in the [proposal](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/es-regexp-dotall-flag).

By default the `.` symbol matches all symbols _but_ new lines. The "dotAll" `s` flag enables matching `\n` and other new line symbols with the `.` symbol:

```js
// Simple.
/./s;

// With unicode `u` flag.
/./su;
```

It is translated into:

```js
// Simple.
/[\0-\uFFFF]/;

// With unicode `u` flag.
/[\0-\u{10FFFF}]/u;
```

### Named capturing groups

See details in the [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-regexp-named-groups).

Capturing groups in JS regexes until recent supported only numbered-matching.

For example, given `/(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/` that matches a date, one cannot be sure which group corresponds to the month and which one is the day without examining the surrounding code. Also, if one wants to swap the order of the month and the day, the group references should also be updated.

Named capture groups provide a nice solution for these issues.

```js
/(?<year>\d{4})-(?<month>\d{2})-(?<day>\d{2})/
```

To backreference a named group, we can use `\k<name>` notation:

```js
/(?<value>a)\k<value>\1/
```

The above regexp is translated into:

```js
/(a)\1\1/
```

### Extended x-flag

> Note: `x`-flag is not yet standardized by ES spec. It's a standard flag in PCRE, Python, and other regexes.

Some features, like `x`-flag currently can only be used via `new RegExp(...)` pattern, since are not supported yet by JavaScript parsers for regexp literals:

```js
new RegExp(`

  # A regular expression for date.

  (?<year>\\d{4})-    # year part of a date
  (?<month>\\d{2})-   # month part of a date
  (?<day>\\d{2})      # day part of a date

`, 'x');
```

Translated into:

```js
/(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/;
```

## Plugin options

The plugin supports the following options.

### `features` option

This options allows choosing which specific transformations to apply. Available features are:

- `dotAll`
- `namedCapturingGroups`
- `xFlag`

which can be specified as an extra object for the plugin:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    ["transform-modern-regexp", {
      "features": [
        "namedCapturingGroups",
        "xFlag"
      ]
    }]
  ]
}
```

> NOTE: if omitted, all features are used by default.

### `useRe` option

This option enables a convenient `re` shorthand, which allows using multiline regexes with _single escape for meta-characters_ (just like in regular expression literals).

Taking example of the date regexep using standard `RegExp` constructor:

```js
new RegExp(`

  # A regular expression for date.

  (?<year>\\d{4})-    # year part of a date
  (?<month>\\d{2})-   # month part of a date
  (?<day>\\d{2})      # day part of a date

`, 'x');
```

we see inconvenient double-escaping of `\\d` (and similarly for other meta-characters). The `re` shorthand allows using single escaping:

```js
re`/

  # A regular expression for date.

  (?<year>\d{4})-    # year part of a date
  (?<month>\d{2})-   # month part of a date
  (?<day>\d{2})      # day part of a date

/x`;
```

As we can see, `re` accepts a regexp in the _literal notation_, which unifies the usage format.

In both cases it's translated to simple regexp literal, so no any runtime overhead:

```js
/(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/
```

> NOTE: it supports only template string literals, you can't use expressions there. Be careful also with `/${4}/` -- this is treated as a template literal expression, and should be written as `/\${4}/` instead.

> NOTE: `\\1` backreferences should still be escaped with _double slashes_. This is due template literal strings do not allow `\1` treating them as Octal numbers.

### `useRuntime` option

> NOTE: the `useRuntime` option is not implemented yet. Track [issue #3](https://github.com/DmitrySoshnikov/babel-plugin-transform-modern-regexp/issues/3) for details.

> NOTE: `useRuntime` is not required: if e.g. named groups are used mostly for readability, the `useRuntime` can be omitted. If you need to access actual group names on the matched results, the runtime support should be used.

This option enables usage of a supporting runtime for the transformed regexes. The `RegExpTree` class is a thin wrapper on top of a native regexp, and has identical API.

> NOTE: `regexp-tree-runtime` should be in your dependencies list.

E.g. the [date expression](#extended-x-flag) from above is translated into:

```js
const RegExpTree = require('regexp-tree-runtime');

...

const re = new RegExpTree(/(\d{4})-(\d{2})-(\d{2})/, {
  flags: 'x',
  source: <original-source>,
  groups: {
    year: 1,
    month: 2,
    day: 3,
  },
});

const result = re.exec('2017-04-17');

// Can access `result.groups`:

console.log(result.groups.year); // 2017
```
